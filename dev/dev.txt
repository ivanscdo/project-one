seems like we will need to use two of youtube's api's
    youtube data api - allows to search, set up playlists
    iframe api - creates the video player on the screen

PROBLEM FINDING; PROBLEM SOLVING
    what is the mvp - minimum viable product - for my part?
        I need a way to search for a video, 
        and I need a way to play that video.

        I need a search bar
        and a video section

    player.cuePlaylist(playlist:String|Array,
                   index:Number,
                   startSeconds:Number,
                   suggestedQuality:String):Void

        The required playlist parameter specifies an array of YouTube video IDs. In the YouTube Data API, the video resource's id property identifies that video's ID.

    user searches for videos, upon selecting video, video's id is pushed to array
    a different array for each user?
    code will cycle between both arrays, first one then the other
